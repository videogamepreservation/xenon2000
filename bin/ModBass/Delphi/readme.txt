             - adapted for BASS version 0.8
             - indexed dll function calls replaced with
               dll function calls by name
             - new procedure: BASS_EAXPreset
               which replaces the EAX_PRESET_xxx definitions

             The following bugs were fixed:
             - The STREAMPROC and SYNCPROC types were declared
               incorrectly; now declared as stdcall
             - BASS_StreamCreate and BASS_ChannelSetSync
               have been declared incorrectly; the last
               parameter must not be declared with var
             The following features have been added:
             - A new demo application has been added
               which shows how to use the stream functions
  07/31/1999 BASS.PAS 0.6
             The first BASS API for Delphi
             Tested with Delphi 3, but should also work
             proberly under Delphi 2 and 4.

  How to install
  ----------------
  Copy BASS.PAS to the \LIB subdirectory of your Delphi path
